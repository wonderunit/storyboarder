# 🎉👍 We're glad you're here! 🎉👍

We're trying to make something beautiful and it sounds like you are too!

We are looking for people to help out in any way possible: Feedback, ideas, bug reports, writing code, brainstorming features, helping design, – anything!

## Submitting issues

Please submit bugs, suggestions, feedback, new feature ideas!

You can do so [here](https://github.com/wonderunit/storyboarder/issues/new).

No idea is too big or too small. Don't feel like you need to write a book. You can keep it short and sweet. But if you want to add pictures or whatever, feel free!

Don't worry if you think someone submitted the issue before, if you have something to add, post it! It helps use prioritize what to work on next.

## Working with us

Would you like to contribute to the project? Yay!

If you submit a pull request, we will need you to sign a CLA: https://cla-assistant.io/wonderunit/storyboarder

If you want to fix some small bugs, feel free to submit a PR. 

If you'd like to work on something bigger than that, hit me up on twitter [@charlesforman](https://twitter.com/charlesforman). We can chat there or in our Slack chat.



**Thanks!!!**

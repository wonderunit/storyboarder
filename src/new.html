      <h1 style="margin-top: 50px;">There are 2 ways to create a new storyboard. Which would you like?</h1>

      <div class="flex-column">

          <h3>Based on a script</h3>
          You can create a storyboard based on a fountain script. If you are working on a story with a script, you can specify the script, and Storyboarder will help you board for each scene and show you the script while you are boarding. Feel free to change the script while boarding.

        </div>
        <div style="padding: 20px; width: 20px; align-self: center;"></div>
        <div class="column">
          <h3>Blank Storyboard</h3>
          You can simply create a totally blank storyboard. Just make boards and draw. If you'd like to import your storyboard into a script based one later, it's easy.<br/><br/>
          If you are just starting, why not create a new blank storyboard for fun?
